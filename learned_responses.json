    "question": "What we need to do if earthquake happened 8.7 magnitude?",
    "answer": "Okay, an 8.7 magnitude earthquake is a catastrophic event. Here’s what you need to do *immediately* to maximize your chances of survival:\n\n**During the Earthquake:**\n\n*   **DROP, COVER, and HOLD ON:** This is your primary defense. Drop to the ground, cover your head and neck with your arms, and find sturdy shelter under a table or desk. If no shelter is available, crouch low against an interior wall. Hold on tightly.\n*   **Stay Away from Hazards:** Move away from windows, glass, heavy objects, and anything that could fall.\n*   **If Outdoors:** Move to an open area away from buildings, power lines, and trees. Lie down if possible.\n*   **If in a Vehicle:** Pull over to a safe location, away from power lines and overpasses. Stay inside the vehicle until the shaking stops.\n\n**Immediately After the Earthquake:**\n\n*   **Assess for Injuries:** Check yourself and those around you for injuries. Provide first aid if you are able.\n*   **Expect Aftershocks:** Be prepared for additional shaking, which can cause further damage. Continue to Drop, Cover, and Hold On during aftershocks.\n*   **Check for Hazards:** Look for fire, gas leaks, and downed power lines. If you smell gas, leave the building immediately and report it to authorities. If you see downed power lines, stay away and report them.\n*   **Evacuate if Necessary:** If your building is damaged or unsafe, evacuate carefully. Follow established evacuation routes if possible.\n*   **Listen to Emergency Broadcasts:** Tune into local radio or television for important information and instructions from emergency officials.\n*   **Contact Emergency Services:** Only use your phone for *critical* emergencies to keep lines open. Call **[Your Local Emergency Number, e.g., 911]** if you need immediate medical assistance or to report a life-threatening situation.\n*   **Conserve Resources:** Water, food, and power may be limited. Use them sparingly.\n\n**Important Reminders:**\n\n*   Stay informed. Official sources are your best resource.\n*   Be patient. Help will arrive, but it may take time.\n*   Help others if you can, but prioritize your own safety first.\n",

  "what is the bad level of pm?": {
    "question": "What is the bad level of PM?",
    "answer": "Okay, let's address PM (Particulate Matter) levels and safety during a general disaster. PM refers to tiny particles in the air that can be harmful when inhaled.\n\n**Understanding PM Levels & Safety**\n\nDuring a disaster, air quality can worsen significantly due to dust, smoke, and debris. Here's a simplified guide:\n\n*   **Levels of Concern:**\n    *   **Good (PM2.5: 0-12 µg/m³ or PM10: 0-54 µg/m³):** Generally safe for everyone.\n    *   **Moderate (PM2.5: 12.1-35.4 µg/m³ or PM10: 55-154 µg/m³):** Sensitive groups (children, elderly, those with respiratory/heart conditions) should limit prolonged outdoor exertion.\n    *   **Unhealthy (PM2.5: 35.5-55.4 µg/m³ or PM10: 155-254 µg/m³):** Everyone, especially sensitive groups, should reduce prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion.\n    *   **Very Unhealthy (PM2.5: 55.5-150.4 µg/m³ or PM10: 255-424 µg/m³):** Everyone should avoid prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion.\n    *   **Hazardous (PM2.5: 150.5+ µg/m³ or PM10: 425+ µg/m³):** Everyone should avoid all physical outdoor activity.\n\n**Actionable Advice:**\n\n*   **DO:**\n    *   **Monitor air quality reports:** Check local news, government websites (e.g., EPA AirNow), or air quality apps.\n    *   **Stay indoors:** When PM levels are unhealthy or higher, stay inside with windows and doors closed, preferably in a room with an air purifier (if available) or an HVAC system with a good filter.\n    *   **Use an N95 mask:** If you must go outside in unhealthy air, wear a properly fitted N95 mask to filter out particles. Ordinary surgical masks offer little protection.\n    *   **Drink plenty of water:** Staying hydrated can help your body cope with air pollution.\n    *   **Seek medical attention:** If you experience breathing difficulties, chest pain, or other serious symptoms, seek immediate medical help.\n*   **DON'T:**\n    *   **Engage in strenuous outdoor activity:** Avoid activities that increase your breathing rate.\n    *   **Burn anything indoors:** This will worsen the air quality. Avoid candles, fireplaces, and smoking.\n    *   **Rely solely on air fresheners:** They don't remove PM and may even add pollutants.\n    *   **Ignore warning signs:** Heed evacuation orders and follow instructions from emergency officials.\n\n**Emergency Contact Reminder:** If you have a medical emergency related to air quality, call emergency services (911 in the US).\n",

  "how many damage of pm2.5?": {
    "question": "How many damage of PM2.5?",
    "answer": "I am an AI and cannot quantify \"damage\" from PM2.5 in your general disaster context without knowing the specific disaster, location, and affected population. PM2.5 (fine particulate matter) is a significant health hazard, especially during and after disasters when air quality can be severely compromised. **Your immediate priority is to protect your respiratory system.**\n\nHere’s what you should do:\n\n*   **DO: Monitor Air Quality Reports:** If possible, check local news, weather reports, or online sources for air quality indices (AQI) specifically mentioning PM2.5 levels. High readings (above 100 or unhealthy categories) indicate a greater risk.\n\n*   **DO: Stay Indoors:** If air quality is poor, remain indoors in a well-ventilated space. Close windows and doors to minimize outside air infiltration.\n\n*   **DO: Use Air Purifiers:** If available, use air purifiers with HEPA filters to remove PM2.5 from indoor air.\n\n*   **DO: Wear a Mask:** If you must go outside, wear a properly fitted N95 respirator mask. Surgical masks offer little protection against PM2.5. Replace masks regularly, especially if they become soiled or damp.\n\n*   **DO: Limit Physical Activity:** Reduce strenuous activities outdoors to minimize inhalation of pollutants.\n\n*   **DON'T: Rely on Homemade Solutions:** Avoid makeshift air filters or masks as they are often ineffective.\n\n*   **DON'T: Burn Wood or Other Materials:** Burning releases additional pollutants into the air, worsening the situation.\n\n*   **DON'T: Ignore Respiratory Symptoms:** If you experience coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, or other respiratory problems, seek medical attention immediately. Consider these problems even if you are indoors.\n\n**If you are experiencing a medical emergency due to respiratory distress, call your local emergency number immediately (e.g., 911 in the US).**\n",
